#Grabbr

Grabbr is a Node.js app that takes a Twitter users favourites from that day, Checks to see if it links to something outside of Twitter and then, a the designated time (I like 1900, I've come home from work, Grabbed a cuppa, I'm ready to read) will send an email to the selected user with the list of articles for them to read.

Bit like Pocket/Readability - But if I used them, I wouldn't have learned anything ;)
